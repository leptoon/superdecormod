# Super Decor - A Supermarket Simulator Decor Mod

A comprehensive modular decoration system for Supermarket Simulator that adds non-functional decorative items to enhance store aesthetics and atmosphere.

https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/1225

## Overview

This mod is a framework to import decorative items into Supermarket Simulator, allowing creators to distribute their 3D assets for Supermarket Simulator and players to create more personalized stores.

Some decor objects may have animations and lighting in the near future, but for now I'm just focusing on static objects for the initial release.

The mod uses a custom placement system, separate from all other objects in the game and designed to be expandable for feature improvements.

There are some notable differences between the default placement system and my custom placement system.
1. There are no dotted white borders. This border would be distracting while you're trying to be creative, especially if you have a lot of decor items and they each have their own border.
2. There are no red and green placement permission indicators. These indicators are helpful for normal furniture but they entirely mask the object texture so having them would hinder creativity. Instead, I've opted to allow full clipping of decor objects rather than attempting to restrict them.
3. Precision height and rotation controls.

### Key Features

- Base mod with modular content packs
- Complete creative freedom with unrestricted decor item placement (walls, ceilings, clipping)
- High quality custom mesh props and fixtures
- Integration with the game's existing purchase and placement systems
- Completely bypasses the placement restriction system allowing decor items to be placed anywhere in the game world
- No white outline and no color changing placement restriction indicator preserves the creative aesthetic
