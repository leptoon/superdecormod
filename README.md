# Super Decor - A Supermarket Simulator Decor Mod

A comprehensive modular decoration system for Supermarket Simulator that adds non-functional decorative items to enhance store aesthetics and atmosphere.

## Overview

This mod introduces a variety of decorative items to Supermarket Simulator, allowing players to create more personalized and realistic looking stores. All items are purely aesthetic and do not affect gameplay mechanics.

Some decor objects may have animations and lighting in the near future, but for now I'm just focusing on static objects for the initial release.

The mod uses my own custom decor placement system, entirely separate from all other objects in the game and designed to be expandable for feature improvements.

There are some notable differences between the default placement system and my custom placement system.
1. There are no dotted white borders. This border would be distracting while you're trying to be creative, especially if you have a lot of decor items and they each have their own border.
2. There are no red and green placement permission indicators. These indicators are helpful for normal furniture but they entirely mask the object texture so having them would hinder creativity. Instead, I've opted to allow full clipping of decor objects rather than attempting to restrict them.
3. Height controls: You can control the height of decor objects by holding Shift and using the mouse wheel. Hold Shift + Ctrl while using the mouse wheel for precision height adjustment. Press Ctrl + T to reset height to zero.
### Key Features
